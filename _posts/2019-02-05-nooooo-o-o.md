When I checked on them this morning I was worried because I couldn't find any of our little baby caterpillars :(

Then when I came back from finding my camera the culprit returned to the scene of the crime.

We barely knew you. But we miss you already and have been hit hard by this tragic loss.

Goodbye our babies
